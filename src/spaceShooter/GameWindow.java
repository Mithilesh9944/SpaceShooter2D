* java.awt          ----> Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is one of the core packages provided by Java for
* 						   creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and handling basic graphics operations.
*                          It's one of the earliest GUI libraries in Java and is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC).
*
* javax.swing.JFrame.----> The JFrame class is part of the Java Swing library, which provides more advanced GUI components and features compared to the AWT library.
* 						    JFrame is a top-level container that represents a window in a Swing-based application. It extends the java.awt.
* 							Frame class and provides additional functionality specific to Swing.
